# Indentation

## No braces

- No braces to indicate blocks of code for class and functionn definitions or flow control

## Blocks of code

- Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced

## The number of spaces

- The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount

## LEading Whitespace

- Leading whitespace at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements
