# Immutable Data Types

- Numbers
- Strings
- Tuples

## Numeric Data Types

- Python supports three different numerical values
- int (Signed Integers)
- float (Real Numbers)
- Complex Numbers
- In Python you can represent `Numbers` in multiple ways: 
- Binary
- Octal
- Hexadecimal

 ## String

 - The continuous set of characters represented within quotations is called as String
 - Python allowsfor either pairs of single or double quotes
 - Python does not support a character type, these are treated as string of length one
 -Python cannot differentiate between single and double quotes

 ## Tuples

 - Tuples consists of a number of values seperate by comma. It is enclosed within parenthesis
 - Unlike Arrays in `C`, a Tuple can have objects of different data types
 
 - Example: 

 ```
 A = (1, 2, 3.5, 'Education')
 print(A)
 ```
